This code contains a basic React Native Reddit app. The app lists the last posts of the r/pics subreddit. The list of posts is generated with a FlatList. Each post contains a thumbnail, date, title, author, score and number of comments field. When a user clicks on the post, a WebView is opened with the contents of the post URL. When you pull the FlatList the posts will be refreshed.

The code includes: 
- Redux
- ES6
- date of creation in relative format (e.g. "1 day ago")
- simple React-navigation
- WebView
